## Attention

**If you still have installed dingz from a previous version, then you need to delete them first and then reinstall the devices.**

The application is still in an beta stage, as both the app and the device are new and still buggy. See the section on: [ToDo](##ToDo)

Please check if your device has the correct firmware version (> 1.3.25) installed.

**Note:**

- **If you have problems after the upgrade, remove and re-register all devices.**
- If you change one off the dingz devices, you must first delete all devices and the dingz Switch itself, afterwards all devices can be re-registered.
